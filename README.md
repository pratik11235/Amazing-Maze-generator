# Amazing-Maze-generator
This repository contains a python code equivalent to the Amazing maze code written in BASIC language.

The maze generator code written in BASIC language is an classic example of Spaghetti code. There are a lot og GOTO statements used in the code that lead to a lot of confusion and difficulty in understanding the logical flow of the code.

The Amazing_maze.py file contains an implementation of the code written in BASIC language. The python implementation of the given code required conversion of the GOTO functionality to Python function call. In the following code, for implementing the same, I have used a function "visit" (which is a sub function of generate_maze function) and called it recursively to avoid the use of while or do while loop.
